# Bootstrap-demo
I just learned the Bootstrap framework from Dr. Angela Yu's course on Udemy, and this is my first project applying what I've learned. This repo contains my initial experiments with Bootstrap's grid system, components, and utilities. Excited to build more using Bootstrap! The project is basically a web page design for TinDog which is Tinder for Dogs.
